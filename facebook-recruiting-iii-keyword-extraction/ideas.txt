1. treat model in different ways:
	1) doc => (wordid,feature,0-1 label), then when given a new doc, predict the probabilities of every word and find out the most likely ones
	2) doc => (docid,feature, wordid label), then when given a new doc, predict directly which tag it is likely to be

1. tf-idf & pick top words
2. tf-idf vector & knn
3. k-means cluster
4. lda to get topic, pick the most likely topic and it's top words
5. make a word list, when given an passage, calculate a score for every word & sort them, the number of tags should also be learned
